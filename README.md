This a demo for validating plug-in development patterns on react component. 

during my daily coding work, find that the amount of common component's code gets bigger, with adding more feature. so I need a solution, if additional features can be integrate with component as a plug-in, it will be good.

I found a open-source library `devextreme-reactive`, it introduce a plug-in development patterns on component. so I have learned source code it's, and abstract the mind mode.

the target of this demo is to validate the mind mode I abstact.
